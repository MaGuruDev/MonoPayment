## Requirements

| Component | Version |
|-----------|---------|
| Magento Open Source / Adobe Commerce | 2.4.4+ |
| PHP | 8.1+ |
| MaGuru MonoCore | ^1.0 |

---

## Installation

```bash
composer require maguru/module-mono-core maguru/module-mono-payment
bin/magento module:enable MaGuru_MonoCore MaGuru_MonoPayment
bin/magento setup:upgrade
bin/magento setup:di:compile
bin/magento cache:flush
```

## Message Queue Setup

MonoPayment publishes several async operations to Magento's message queue instead of calling the Monobank API synchronously from observers. **These queues do nothing until a consumer processes them** — Magento does not run consumers automatically out of the box.

| Consumer | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `mono_payment.invoice.cancel` | Cancel invoice on order cancellation |
| `mono_payment.invoice.finalize` | Auto-capture Hold invoice on shipment |
| `mono_payment.invoice.remove` | Remove invoice (admin action) |
| `mono_payment.invoice.receipt` | Send electronic receipt email |

**Recommended:** register the consumers in `app/etc/env.php` so Magento's own cron picks them up automatically (no extra process to manage):

```php
'cron_consumers_runner' => [
    'cron_run' => true,
    'max_messages' => 200,
    'consumers' => [
        'mono_payment.invoice.cancel',
        'mono_payment.invoice.finalize',
        'mono_payment.invoice.remove',
        'mono_payment.invoice.receipt',
    ]
],
```

**Alternative:** run a persistent process per consumer under supervisor/systemd:

```bash
bin/magento queue:consumers:start mono_payment.invoice.cancel
```

Without one of the above, Hold auto-capture on shipment, invoice cancel/remove, and receipt emails will silently never happen — messages just accumulate unprocessed in the `queue_message` table.

## Features

### Checkout Flows
- **Redirect** — customer is redirected to Monobank `pageUrl`, then back to your store
- **iFrame** — Monobank payment page loads in an inline modal overlay; customer never leaves checkout
- **Saved Card** — return customers can pay with a previously saved card in one click
- **MonoPay Button** — Monobank's native JS payment button with ECDSA-signed initialization

### Payment Types
- **Debit** — immediate charge
- **Hold** — authorize on order placement, capture on shipment creation

### Saved Cards (Wallet)
- Cards are tokenized via Monobank after first payment
- Customer account page at `/mono/account/cards` — view and delete saved cards
- Merchant-initiated recurring charges via `WalletService::charge()`

### QR Payments
- Inject `qrId` into any invoice for QR terminal-based payments
- Admin page: **System → Monobank → QR Terminals** (live list from Monobank API)
- `QR Amount Type` config: `merchant` terminals require `amount` in the API call; `client`/`fix` terminals reject any amount field — the module strips it automatically (including `basketOrder.sum`/`total`)
- Only `merchant`-type QR terminals are compatible with the full API checkout flow

### Split / Marketplace
- Inject `splitReceiverId` into `basketOrder` per order item
- Admin page: **System → Monobank → Split Receivers** (live list from Monobank API)

### Subscriptions (Recurring)
- Full CRUD: create, status, list, edit (cancel), remove, payment history
- Local DB tracking in `mono_payment_subscription` table
- Admin grid: **System → Monobank → Subscriptions**
- Webhook handler `POST /mono/payment/subscription` for charge and status events

### Statement Reconciliation
- Daily sync via `GET /api/merchant/statement`
- Admin grid with CSV export: **System → Monobank → Statement**
- CLI: `bin/magento mono:statement:sync [--from=Y-m-d] [--to=Y-m-d]`
- Cron: daily at 08:00

### Currency Rates
- `GET /bank/currency` (no auth required) → `directory_currency_rate`
- Cron: every 4 hours

### Order Lifecycle
- `payment_action = authorize` — no Magento invoice is created during `placeOrder`; invoice is created only after webhook `success` (debit) or after Hold capture → webhook `success` (hold)
- Hold invoice → auto-capture on shipment (`ShipmentSaveAfter` → `finalize` queue)
- Hold manual capture → **Capture Payment** button in admin order view → `POST /api/merchant/invoice/finalize` → webhook `success` → Magento invoice created
- Cancel invoice on order cancel (`CancelAfter`)
- Refund via credit memo (`CreditMemoSaveAfter`)
- Status polling cron every 5 minutes (fallback if webhook fails)

### Fiscal Integration Hooks
- Dispatches `mono_payment_before_invoice_create` — allows MonoFiscal to inject `basketOrder`
- Dispatches `mono_payment_before_invoice_cancel` — allows MonoFiscal to inject fiscalization items
- Dispatches `mono_payment_invoice_success` — triggers fiscal check fetch and receipt email
